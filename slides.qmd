## Problem Statement {.center}

Among those who take cholesterol lowering medication, does taking this **medication** have an effect on their **systolic blood pressure**?

::: {.notes}
up next: background
:::

## Background {.smaller .center}
  - Controlling blood pressure reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease. 
  - Systolic above 130 mmHg is considered to be hypertensive.
  - Doctors often prescribe both antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs, as patients with high blood pressure often have high cholesterol.
  - Ways to control blood pressure include exercise, pharmacotherapy, a healthy diet, regulating sodium, reducing alcohol use, smoking, getting sleep, reducing stress, and regular health check-ups.
  
::: {.notes}

Cholesterol plague and calcium cause your arteries to become hard and narrow. Statin has been proven to be effective in minimizing the risk of cardiovascular adverse events.

up next: We drew a DAG to represent the context.

up next: Using this DAG, we attempted to answer the question with causal methods

## Statistical Analysis {.center}
  - Clean the dataset
  - Build a propensity model and ATT weights 
  - Run diagnostics on the propensity model
  - Build an outcome model
  - Run sensitivity analysis

## Key Results {.smaller .center}
  - The cleaned data had 20,822 rows and 8 columns after deriving $X, Y, \boldsymbol{Z}$ from our adjustment set and dropping missing values.
  - The propensity model and ATT weighting produced data that was balanced.
  - Using a sandwich estimator to derive the standard errors, we observe an ATT of -3.746 with 95% CI (-4.782,-2.71).
  - A conservative unmeasured confounding variable setup would require an effect size of over 6 times the ATT to tip the CI to the null at the 95% level.

## Conclusion {.center}
Given our observed ATT of -3.746 with 95% CI (-4.782,-2.71), we conclude that those currently taking medication should continue to take this medication, as it lowers their systolic blood pressure.

::: {.notes}
notes: limitations include that some of those confounders we address had to be absorbed into the sensitivity analysis
