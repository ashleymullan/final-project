	abstract = {Several large epidemiological studies have reported an inverse relationship between blood pressure and physical activity. However, longitudinal intervention studies are more appropriate for assessing the effects of physical activity. We performed meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials involving dynamic aerobic endurance training or resistance training. The meta-analysis on endurance training involved 72 trials and 105 study groups. After weighting for the number of trained participants, training induced significant net reductions in resting and daytime ambulatory blood pressure of, respectively, 3.0/2.4 mmHg (P \&lt; 0.001) and 3.3/3.5 mmHg (P \&lt; 0.01). The reduction in resting blood pressure was more pronounced in the 30 hypertensive study groups (−6.9/-4.9) than in the others (−1.9/-1.6; P \&lt; 0.001 for all). Systemic vascular resistance decreased by 7.1\% (P \&lt; 0.05), plasma norepinephrine by 29\% (P \&lt; 0.001), and plasma renin activity by 20\% (P \&lt; 0.05). Body weight decreased by 1.2 kg (P \&lt; 0.001), waist circumference by 2.8 cm (P \&lt; 0.001), percentage body fat by 1.4\% (P \&lt; 0.001) and the homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance by 0.31 units (P \&lt; 0.01); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 0.032 mmol/l (P \&lt; 0.05). Resistance training has been less well studied. A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials (12 study groups) on mostly dynamic resistance training revealed a weighted net reduction in blood pressure of 3.2 (P =0.10)/3.5 (P \&lt; 0.01) mmHg associated with exercise. Endurance training decreases blood pressure through a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, in which the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system appear to be involved, and favourably affects concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. The few available data suggest that resistance training can reduce blood pressure. Exercise is a cornerstone therapy for the prevention, treatment and control of hypertension.},

	abstract = {Background 
          Blood pressure (BP) control is reported to be poor in hypertensive patients worldwide.
          Objective 
          BP levels, the rate of BP control, prevalence of risk factors and total cardiovascular risk were assessed in a large cohort of hypertensive patients, derived from recent surveys performed in Italy.
          Methods 
          Fifteen studies on hypertension, performed in different clinical settings (general population, general clinical practice, specialist outpatient clinics and hypertension centres) over the past decade were considered.
          Results 
          The overall sample included 52 715 hypertensive patients (26 315 men and 26 410 women, mean age 57.3 ± 6.9 years). Despite the high percentage of patients on stable antihypertensive treatment (n = 36 556, 69\%), mean systolic and diastolic BP levels were 147.8 ± 8.5 and 89.5 ± 5.2 mmHg, respectively. On the basis of the nature of the study (population surveys or clinical referrals), systolic BP levels were consistently higher than the normality threshold in both settings (142.6 ± 12.4/84.8 ± 3.7 mmHg and 150.4 ± 4.6/91.9 ± 4.1 mmHg, respectively). The BP stratification could be assessed in 40 829 individuals: 4.5\% had optimal, 9.2\% normal and 8.3\% high-normal BP levels, however, the large majority were in grade 1 (39\%) or grades 2–3 (32.6\%) hypertension. In the overall sample, 55.9\% of hypertensive patients had hypercholesterolemia, 28.7\% were smokers, 36.4\% were overweight or obese and 15.0\% had diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular risk stratification was assessed in 37 813 hypertensives: 23.2\% had low, 33.9\% moderate, 30.2\% high and 12.7\% very high added risk.
          Conclusion 
          Our analysis demonstrates the persistence of poor BP control and high prevalence of risk factors, supporting the need for more effective, comprehensive and urgent actions to improve the clinical management of hypertension.},

The date of final data collection was 2018.Calendar year.Mean BP was computed using 3 measurements. The primary outcome of BP control was defined as systolic BP level lower than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP level lower than 90 mm Hg.Among the 51 761 participants included in this analysis, the mean (SD) age was 48 (19) years and 25 939 (50.1\%) were women; 43.2\% were non-Hispanic White adults; 21.6\%, non-Hispanic Black adults; 5.3\%, non-Hispanic Asian adults; and 26.1\%, Hispanic adults. Among the 18 262 adults with hypertension, the age-adjusted estimated proportion with controlled BP increased from 31.8\% (95\% CI, 26.9\%-36.7\%) in 1999-2000 to 48.5\% (95\% CI, 45.5\%-51.5\%) in 2007-2008 (P \&lt; .001 for trend), remained stable and was 53.8\% (95\% CI, 48.7\%-59.0\%) in 2013-2014 (P = .14 for trend), and then declined to 43.7\% (95\% CI, 40.2\%-47.2\%) in 2017-2018 (P = .003 for trend). Compared with adults who were aged 18 years to 44 years, it was estimated that controlled BP was more likely among those aged 45 years to 64 years (49.7\% vs 36.7\%; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.18 [95\% CI, 1.02-1.37]) and less likely among those aged 75 years or older (37.3\% vs 36.7\%; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.81 [95\% CI, 0.65-0.97]). It was estimated that controlled BP was less likely among non-Hispanic Black adults vs non-Hispanic White adults (41.5\% vs 48.2\%, respectively; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.81-0.96). Controlled BP was more likely among those with private insurance (48.2\%), Medicare (53.4\%), or government health insurance other than Medicare or Medicaid (43.2\%) vs among those without health insurance (24.2\%) (multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.40 [95\% CI, 1.08-1.80], 1.47 [95\% CI, 1.15-1.89], and 1.36 [95\% CI, 1.04-1.76], respectively). Controlled BP was more likely among those with vs those without a usual health care facility (48.4\% vs 26.5\%, respectively; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.48 [95\% CI, 1.13-1.94]) and among those who had vs those who had not had a health care visit in the past year (49.1\% vs 8.0\%; multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio, 5.23 [95\% CI, 2.88-9.49]).In a series of cross-sectional surveys weighted to be representative of the adult US population, the prevalence of controlled BP increased between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008, did not significantly change from 2007-2008 through 2013-2014, and then decreased after 2013-2014.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients with hypertension remain at increased risk of micro‐ and macrovascular complications unless their elevated blood pressure (BP) can be adequately controlled. However, helping patients with hypertension to get to, and stay at, target BP goals can be difficult in everyday clinical practice. Scope: The present study describes the magnitude of this problem in various regions and attempts to analyse possible underlying reasons. For this purpose, a non-systematic literature review using Medline database was performed. Findings: Reasons for suboptimal blood pressure control include factors under the control of the physician, such as insufficient education and motivation of the patient, reluctance to initiate lifestyle changes or drug treatment; overlooking the importance of controlling systolic BP (especially in the elderly) and failure to modify and expand therapy when it is indicated (e.g. use of combination therapy if monotherapy is proving inadequate for BP lowering). Patient-related factors that may give rise to inadequate BP control include a lack of awareness of the relevance of hypertension, failure to comply with recommended lifestyle modifications and poor medication compliance (e.g. because of forgetfulness, tolerability problems, or incomplete understanding of the long-term nature of therapy). Conclusions: These issues can be addressed by ensuring that doctors adhere more closely to national or international guidelines and that patients are well-informed about the need for long-term therapy. Further approaches include simplifying the treatment regimen (e.g. use of well-tolerated, fixed-dose combinations) and using various measures to reduce forgetfulness. With properly directed therapy and consideration of potential physician- and patient-related barriers to poor BP control, more hypertensive patients in everyday clinical practice can achieve target BP goals and thereby realise the proven benefits of antihypertensive therapy for decreasing their cardiovascular risk.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was performed of the effect of 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) on blood pressure in humans including the randomized, controlled trials of statin therapy (20 trials and 828 patients) in which concomitant antihypertensive treatment (if any) remained unchanged throughout the study. A total of 291 and 272 patients were given a statin or placebo, respectively, in parallel group trials, whereas 265 took part in crossover trials receiving a statin and placebo (or probucol, in 1 trial). Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in patients on statin than in those on placebo or control hypolipidemic drug (mean difference: −1.9 mm Hg; 95\% CI: −3.8 to −0.1). The effect was greater when the analysis was restricted to studies with a baseline systolic blood pressure {\textgreater}130 mm Hg (Δ systolic blood pressure: −4.0; 95\% CI: −5.8 to −2.2 mm Hg). There was a trend for lower diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving statin therapy compared with control: −0.9 mm Hg (95\% CI: −2.0 to 0.2) overall and −1.2 mm Hg (95\% CI: −2.6 to 0.1) in studies with a baseline diastolic blood pressure {\textgreater}80 mm Hg. In general, the higher the baseline blood pressure, the greater the effect of statins on blood pressure (P=0.066 for systolic blood pressure and P=0.023 for diastolic blood pressure). The blood pressure response to statins was unrelated to age, changes in serum cholesterol, or length of the trial. In conclusion, statin therapy has a relatively small but statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on blood pressure.},

Using a meta‐analysis approach, the aim of this study was to explore whether certain statins have the potential to lower blood pressure (BP). For the period 2002–2022, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for the studies that examined the effect of statins on blood pressure in normotensive or hypertensive individuals. Randomized controlled clinical trials that investigated this effect were included based on our inclusion criteria. Our primary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The final analysis of the study included 49 RCTs involving 45 173 participants randomized to receive either statins or placebo. Among the two groups, the total weighted mean difference (WMD) for systolic blood pressure (ΔSBP) was –1.42 (95\% CI: –2.38, –0.46; p = .004) and diastolic blood pressure (ΔDBP) was 0.82 (95\% CI: –1.28, –0.36; p = .0005). Despite various studies suggesting the efficacy of statins in blood pressure lowering to be significant and non‐significant both, we observed a decrease in SBP and DBP both, although the change was not as large and could be considered significant. A large multicenter, multi‐ethnic, large sample pool size, and a long period follow‐up study is still required to assert these claims.},

Hypertension doubles coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Treating hypertension only reduces CHD risk ≈25\%. Treating hypercholesterolemia in hypertensive patients reduces residual CHD risk {\textgreater}35\%.

Methods and Results—

To assess progress in concurrent hypertension and hypercholesterolemia control, National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2004, and 2005 to 2010 were analyzed. Hypertension was defined by blood pressure ≥140/≥90 mm Hg, current medication treatment, and 2-told hypertension status; blood pressure {\textless}140/{\textless}90 defined control. Hypercholesterolemia was defined by ATP III criteria based on 10-year CHD risk, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; values below diagnostic thresholds defined control. Across surveys, 60.7\% to 64.3\% of hypertensives were hypercholesterolemic. From 1988 to 1994 to 2005 to 2010, control of LDL-C rose (9.2\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 6.6\%–11.9\%] to 45.4\% [95\% CI, 42.6\%–48.3\%]), concomitant hypertension and LDL-C (5.0\% [95\% CI, 3.3\%–6.7\%] to 30.7\% [95\% CI, 27.9\%–33.4\%]), and combined hypertension, LDL-C, and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.8\% [95\% CI, 0.4\%–3.2\%] to 26.9\% [95\% CI, 24.4\%–29.5\%]). By multivariable logistic regression, factors associated with concomitant hypertension, LDL-C, and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol control (odds ratio [95\% CI]) were statin (10.7 [8.1–14.3]) and antihypertensive (3.32 [2.45–4.50]) medications, age (0.77 [0.69–0.88]/10-year increase), ≥2 healthcare visits/yr (1.90 [1.26-2.87]), black race (0.59 [0.44–0.80]), Hispanic ethnicity (0.62 [0.43–0.90]), cardiovascular disease (0.44 [0.34–0.56]), and diabetes mellitus (0.54 [0.42–0.70]).

Conclusions—

Despite progress, opportunities for improving concomitant hypertension and hypercholesterolemia control persist. Prescribing antihypertensive and antihyperlipidemic medications to achieve treatment goals, especially for older, minority, diabetic, and cardiovascular disease patients, and accessing healthcare at least biannually could improve concurrent risk factor control and CHD prevention.},

	abstract = {A symposium held at the 29th European Meeting on Hypertension and Cardiovascular Protection in Milan, Italy, discussed the potential impact and long-term benefits of early active management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with hypertension, and potential barriers to this strategy. Hypertension often aggregates with other cardiovascular risk factors, exponentially increasing morbidity and mortality. While effective therapies to treat hypertension exist, a substantial number of patients still experience major cardiovascular events. Two major issues account for these disappointing results: interventions initiated too late in the disease trajectory and lack of effective translation of the research findings into daily clinical practice. Results from genetic studies suggest that lifetime exposure to lower blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol levels due to protective gene mutations, can provide greater cardiovascular benefits than middle-/late-age interventions. Clinical guidelines suggest adding statins to BP-lowering therapies for further cardiovascular benefits in most hypertensive patients; however, real-world data show that physicians’ compliance with these recommendations and patients’ adherence to BP- and lipid-lowering treatments remain poor, resulting in poor risk factor control and an increased risk of adverse outcomes. The use of single-pill combinations (SPC) can partially mitigate these issues, as they are associated with increased patient adherence and improved BP control. Treatment with SPC has been recommended in the European Hypertension Guidelines, but optimization of the total CVD risk may need adoption of more ambitious treatment strategies aimed to deliver single pills that control multiple CVD risk factors. Amlodipine, perindopril and atorvastatin have been shown to improve BP and lipid levels to a great extent when given separately, and this combination has also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes. Overall, early intervention in patients with hypertension with use of an effective, high-intensity cardiovascular risk reduction regimen and attention to medication adherence through reducing pill burden are likely to result in optimal outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
Recent review of hypertension guidelines requires fresh updates of prevalence and control rates. Though retrospective analysis provided burden estimates, control rates were grossly misleading. We set out to update the prevalence and control rates of hypertension in the USA using contemporary NHANES data.

Methods
Persons with mean systolic blood pressure (mSBP) ≥130 mmHg or mean diastolic blood pressure (mDBP) ≥80 mmHg or self-reported current use of antihypertensive medications were classified as hypertensives. Hypertensives on medications with mSBP {\textless}130 mmHg and mDBP {\textless}80 mmHg were classified as having well-controlled hypertension. Subgroup comparisons of hypertension prevalence were computed using Chi-square test. Predictors of hypertension and well-controlled BP were assessed using multivariable logistic regressions. Two tailed p-values {\textless}0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
The prevalence of hypertension in the USA in 2017–2018 was 49.64\% (95\% CI 46.67–52.61) corresponding to 115(95\% CI 104–128) million persons. NH Blacks: 58.53\% (95\% CI 55.39–61.60); Men: 54.46\% (95\% CI 51.01–57.87); older persons and obese individuals: 61.03\% (95\% CI 57.31–64.63) as well as persons with diabetes and CKD, comparatively. The overall rate of well-controlled hypertension was 39.64\% (95\% CI 36.20–42.81). Persons with at least a college degree: OR 2.20(95\% CI 1.02–5.04, p=0.049) and persons with incomes ≥3 times the poverty threshold; OR 1.88(95\% CI 1.1.8–2.99, p=0.011) had higher rates of well-controlled hypertension when compared to lowest categories.

Conclusion
One in every two persons ≥20 years in the USA has hypertension with only 39.64\% on medications having well-controlled hypertension. Significant discrepancies exist in the burden and control rates in different subpopulation categories. Targeted interventions could help improve the prevalence and hypertension control rates in the USA.},
